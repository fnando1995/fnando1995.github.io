description:
    I am actively developing a robust AI solution that leverages deep learning to enhance product detection on retail shelves. By collecting and labeling data to improve existing public datasets like SKU110k, this project aims to create a highly accurate, scalable detector for real-time product detection and future recognition for shelf auditing. The enhanced dataset will drive better performance in inventory management and reduce discrepancies, ultimately optimizing retail operations with precise, AI-powered auditing solutions.
